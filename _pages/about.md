I am a Ph.D. student at University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), working with
Professor [Yang Liu](http://www.yliuu.com). I am currently interested in weakly supervised learning (learning with imperfect information) and explainable neural networks (network understanding). Previously, I spent two years at YouTu Lab, Tencent, working with [Ke Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mfWsFM0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Xing Sun](https://www.sunxing.org).

## Personal Life/Hobbies

I like to play billiards and basketball.

My favorite mobile game is Identity V. (I am a top player of hunter "spider").

My idol is Michael Jackson since I was very young. I was also a leading dancer in college. 

I love dogs, especially wolfhound and golden retriever. I hope every dog can be treated gently.
