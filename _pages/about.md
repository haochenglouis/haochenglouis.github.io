Currently, I am a researcher at Youtu Lab, Tencent. My job is to explore efficient learning algorithms and apply them on various applications. I am
interested in weakly supervised learning (learning with imperfect information) and explainable neural networks (network understanding). I received master degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by [Yanlin Geng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bTVgLkQAAAAJ&hl=en).

## My Life 


- I have a beautiful girlfriend and I am grateful for her appearing in my life.
- I am a big fan of Michael Jackson and have some limited books of him. 
- Affected by Michael, I used to dance in the college as a leader (Just for fun).
- I like to play basketball and billiards with my friends.
- I have watched many Japanese animes. Some of them, I think, reconstructed my values.
- My favorite mobile game is Identity 5 (第五人格).
- I love dogs very much and want to raise one recently.
